/* Background job timing: when an old terminal state counts and when it does not.
 *
 * Failure modes listed first, one case each:
 * - The first screen reads the last run's terminal state and reports it as this run's receipt;
 * - Between clicking start and the reread returning, the last run's terminal state in cache stands in for this run;
 * - This run finishes before the first reread and its result is dropped;
 * - The same terminal state reported twice;
 * - When the cached thing is the whole card, swapping in the snapshot washes away the card's other fields;
 * - On a failed start, the old terminal state is taken as this run's result.
 *
 * The reread is held by a manually released `pending()`: if the fake fetch answered on the spot, the gap in between would not
 * exist and the first two could not be tested. */
