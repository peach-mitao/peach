/* The sidebar (resident component `sidebar`, `sidebar-island.tsx`) and its contract with the shell.
 *
 * It renders the scrolling layer inside the left drawer `#drawer`: the header row's empty slot, the nav column, the sliding
 * glass over the nav, and the filter groups that appear per context below the nav (catalog and profile pages: sources,
 * duration, origin, aspect, creators, tags; follows page: sources, duration, content tags). The drawer itself, its open/close,
 * the bottom bar (light/dark, color, settings keys), brand and collapse button belong to the shell: they are anchors for
 * several overlays in the shell, and at `attached` the shell moves brand and collapse button into the header row's slot.
 *
 * Filters, routing and fetching stay with the shell. Members, pressed states and counts are computed by the shell and pushed
 * in; clicks return to the shell's `commitContextFilter`, `navTo` and the follows page's filters. Nav order reads the same
 * `appSettings` (`host.store`): when the settings panel or the column's own drag changes the order, the sidebar reorders on the
 * spot per the store's notification. */
