/* Link management's data contract.
 *
 * External links live on other people's servers and rot without notice: measured, 152 of 719 did not open, and on the profile
 * page they look identical to good links until clicked. So the check must be rerunnable at any time.
 *
 * Three truths, three keys, each on its own cadence:
 * - `['links']` is the current state of links in the library, a pure database read that loads with the page and never polls.
 * - `['links','check']` is the state of the networked check run, asked every two seconds while `running`.
 * - `['links','prune']` is the state of the deletion run, likewise on the `running` switch.
 * Merged into one key, every two-second poll round would re-render the read-only stats block above. */
