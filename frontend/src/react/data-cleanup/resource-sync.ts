/* Resource sync's data contract: per library record, look up the file on local disks and cloud drives (ADR-0080, ADR-0087).
 *
 * One check, one run. The check reports per source the records whose files are no longer on disk, empty folders and
 * unreadable directories, plus orphaned cache. Records whose files are gone come in two tiers: those with personal records are
 * marked vanished and the record stays; the rest are permanently deleted (including anything in trash). The run only accepts
 * this check's candidates, re-verifies each, handles both tiers, then deletes empty folders bottom-up and clears orphaned
 * cache.
 *
 * Two background jobs, two keys. The scan endpoint both starts the job and reads status (`status_only`); for the run, GET
 * reads the snapshot and POST starts it; both poll on the `running` switch and stay silent while idle.
 *
 * This block only appears when some source has a root configured (`hasResourceRoots`), so both states follow source
 * reachability: only with roots does it join first-screen prefetch, and machines without this block avoid two extra requests
 * when entering data management. */
