/* The image in the card's cover cell (`[data-media-art]`).
 *
 * The image is an HTML fragment assembled by the legacy layer, and after load the shell re-frames and swaps the derived tier
 * for the original on the same `<img>` (see `../catalog-grid/artwork.ts`). The large-image and small-image fragments differ
 * only in framing class names, and rewriting by whole fragment would replace every image with a new element: the derived tier
 * re-decodes, framing waits for `load` to recompute, and the whole screen flashes at once. So images are recognized by
 * `identity` (the fragment the same video assembles from its small image): while identity holds, the previous fragment is
 * kept and layout is handed to `relayout` on the same image; only a changed image rewrites the fragment. */
