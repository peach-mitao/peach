/* Duplicates' data contract and reductions.
 *
 * The criterion is "same code + similar duration + matching volume marker", not same-code-means-duplicate: compilations,
 * volumes and mixed-in ads share one code, and keeping the largest by code alone would delete content. The server has already
 * judged by this rule; the frontend only picks who survives per group. Bulk operations always go through `dispose` into trash,
 * which is reversible; permanent deletion still only happens from trash, one at a time.
 *
 * The data management page's duplicates card reads the same truth's `total`/`files`/`reclaimable`, so it subscribes to the
 * `DUPLICATES_KEY` below instead of sending another `?limit=1`: the server must scan the whole table to group for either
 * limit, and the saved return bytes buy the risk of two readouts disagreeing. */
