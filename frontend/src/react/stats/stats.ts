/* The stats page's data contract and reductions: `/api/stats` serves the whole page in one request.
 *
 * The endpoint is declared once in `frontend/src`, here only (`tests/test_frontend_build.py` watches this).
 * This page is a snapshot of the database right now, with no background jobs and no polling: the whole page has one
 * `queryKey`, and the four metrics on screen and the three panels below all read the same copy; fetching separately would
 * produce one fresh cell next to a stale one.
 *
 * Sizes go through `src/core/index.ts`'s `fmtSize`, the same basis as library, duplicates and quality upgrades; playback
 * duration, percentages and the charts' binning are this page's own reductions, written as pure functions here and verified
 * directly by vitest. */
