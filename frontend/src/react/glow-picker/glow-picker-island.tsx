/* The sidebar color card: the card opened by the color button at the bottom of the sidebar, modeled on the "Accent color"
 * button at boardui.com's bottom right.
 *
 * The header is a title plus a "Reset" text key; the body is two groups of 6-column balls, glow presets on top (the same group
 * as the settings panel's "Color scheme", `GlowPresetGrid`) and accent colors below (BoardUI's own radial-gradient ball), with
 * a full-width primary button at the bottom leading to detailed settings. Measurements in
 * docs/reference-snapshots/feralui-studio-boardui-accent-measured.md.
 *
 * Resident component `glow-picker` (the resident table in `router/managed-routes.tsx`): the route tree renders the content
 * directly as children of the shell's resident `#boardGlowMenu` at the end of body, the host being the card itself; the shell
 * opens it at startup. The card has no imperative handle and reads and writes the shell's UI preference store. Anchoring,
 * open/close, glass material and mutual exclusion with the media library menu all live in the shell's `wireAnchoredMenu`; the
 * card does not switch to a BoardUI Popover: that motion and material would have to be re-created outside Popover to match
 * pixels, and the re-creation would be a second copy.
 *
 * When glow is off only the accent color remains to pick on the card: the upper group of balls and its "Reset" control a layer
 * that is not rendered anymore, and clicking them does nothing on screen, so the group collapses and the card only states the
 * one thing that still works. */
