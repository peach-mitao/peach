/* The playlists page's data contract and its three write operations.
 *
 * Reads `/api/playlists` (`q_playlists` in `src/peach/web_playlists.py`, sorted by last change); writes always POST
 * `/api/playlist`. The write endpoint returns the whole list with `items`, not the list page's row shape, and renaming also
 * touches `updated_at` and changes the sort, so after any write the list key refetches; the response is never assembled into
 * cache.
 *
 * Saving a Mix on home and coming back must show it: the first screen's `prefetch` refetches from the server every time and
 * never reads the previous copy from cache. */
