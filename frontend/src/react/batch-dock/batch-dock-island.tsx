/* Batch bar (ADR-0031 step 11g): the floating bar at the bottom during multi-select on catalog, trash, junk files and the
 * follows page.
 *
 * Resident component `batch-dock` (the resident table in `router/managed-routes.tsx`): the route tree renders it into the
 * shell's resident `[data-batch-dock]` at the end of body, the host being that node itself. The shell only gets the imperative
 * entry `configureBatchDock` provides: each re-render of selection state pushes a count and context; the handle writes them
 * into this module's store and notifies via `flushSync`, so the bar is rendered by the time the call returns and the shell can
 * immediately refresh the glass optics (`syncGlassOptics`). The bar's shell is the shared `SelectionDock` (review, tags page
 * and follow management use the same one), which needs the tokens and Preflight of the `.peach-react` scope, so the component
 * wraps itself in a `display: contents` `.peach-react` that takes no box.
 *
 * The keys on the bar are transparent `<button>`s: size, border, font size and the 17px glyphs follow ADR-0031's pre-migration
 * baseline, all in `batch-dock.css`; BoardUI `Button`'s medium tier is a 20px glyph with 8px padding and does not match. Danger
 * keys carry `data-danger`, and their red reads the site-wide danger-key rule in `../styles.css`. */
