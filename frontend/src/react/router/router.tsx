/* Client-side navigation (ADR-0031, "React Router shell-stage takeover"): React Router's Declarative mode takes over history.
 * The management pages, the playlists and follows pages, the index and profile pages, the catalog grid and the junk queue, plus
 * the in-page components inside those pages (home filter bar, home new-releases row, top-bar search dropdown) and the resident
 * components (background tasks, bottom batch bar, sidebar color card, management header, immersive mode, settings panel,
 * sidebar, details stage) (`managed-routes.tsx`) are rendered by this tree. Every page, immersive mode and the details overlay
 * open by route match (the elements under `pages/`); the shell does no dispatching: it only subscribes to keep the title and
 * sidebar in sync with history and writes the address when the page changes.
 *
 * The low-level `<Router>` is used and history is the `@peach/history` instance: the address must be written at app startup,
 * while a history `<BrowserRouter>` builds itself only listens for `popstate` and never sees entries the shell pushes.
 * `unstable_HistoryRouter` is not used either: its updates are wrapped in `startTransition` by default, so two changes in a row
 * coalesce into one render and back/forward would open one step fewer.
 *
 * The page host is a sibling of the two `<Routes>` groups and lives for the whole session: rendered pages follow the entries
 * registered here (`@peach/history`'s `openManagedRoute`, one per container), and when the details stage stacks on top and the
 * address changes to `/assets/:id`, the page stays in place.
 *
 * Routes come in two groups: the page group matches on the background recorded by the entry itself (`usr.backgroundLocation`,
 * the startup entry does not read it), so the page the details stack on keeps matching and the background page is not
 * remounted; the overlay group matches the details and queue entries on the real address (`OVERLAY_PATHS`, `pages/overlay.tsx`).
 * In the page group, management, follows, index, profile, catalog and immersive each mount the element that opens that page by
 * address (`pages/managed.tsx`, `pages/follow.tsx`, `pages/index-entity.tsx`, `pages/catalog.tsx`, `pages/immerse.tsx`);
 * overlay addresses without a background also get a slot in the page group: videos and queues backfill the catalog grid, and
 * follow details only yield `#stats`. `path="*"` is an unrecognized address; nothing opens.
 *
 * One render error only takes down the surface that threw: each surface wraps its own error boundary (`SurfaceBoundary`), the
 * root has none, and the two `<Routes>` groups do not unmount because one surface did. Errors go through the root's
 * `onCaughtError` to `reportError`, one per occurrence. */
